# This bootstraps the Blue Button backend systems:
#
# 1. Ensures that the system running the play adds all of the systems to be
#    managed all to `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts`.
# 2. Adds/updates the SSH public key used by Jenkins to this project.
# 3. Authorizes that Jenkins SSH key to run deploys on all of the systems
#    to be managed.
#
# Due to the catch-22 presented by the above (Jenkins can't manage the systems
# until they are configured to allow it), this play will have to be run
# manually, as needed, using the SSH credentials of someone already trusted on
# the systems.
