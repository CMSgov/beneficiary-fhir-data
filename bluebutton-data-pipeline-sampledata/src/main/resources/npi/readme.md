# NPI/NPPES Data

This was downloaded from <http://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPI_Files.html>. Because that's 5GB of data, and incredibly unwieldy, the `NpiSubsetter` utility in this project was created and used to extract about 10,000 records randomly from it. The `npidata-20050523-20160313-subset-10000.csv` file here is the result of that.
