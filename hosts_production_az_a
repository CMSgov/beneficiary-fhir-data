# Production Inventory
# ====================
#
# To help prevent accidental deployments into the wrong environment, this
# inventory file only contains the Production servers in Availability Zone 'A'.
#
# Our security policies mandate individual user accounts for everyone; we can't
# specify a shared username that all Ansible connections will use. Accordingly,
# users must have an SSH alias for these systems in their `~/.ssh/config`
# file, which must define the `HostName` `User`, and `IdentityFile` for each
# system.

# This environment-wide group allows us to store all of the security-sensitive
