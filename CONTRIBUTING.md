# Welcome!

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.

Although this is a public repo, contributing to the BFD is for CMS-approved contributors only, not outside contributors.

## Contributing to BFD

### Background

BFD exists to enable the CMS Enterprise to drive innovation in data sharing so that beneficiaries and their healthcare partners have the data they need to make informed decisions about their healthcare.

We provide a comprehensive, performant, and trustworthy platform to transform the way that the CMS enterprise shares and uses data by providing [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/)-formatted data, including beneficiary demographic, enrollment, and claims data.

Review the [README](https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data/blob/master/README.md) for additional information on BFD.

### Team Specific Guidelines

The BFD team operates through a core team structure that guides development and maintains project standards. For more information about team structure, refer to the COMMUNITY.md file.

### Building Dependencies

For setting up your local environment with all necessary dependencies, please follow the [development environment setup guide](https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data/wiki/Local-Environment-Setup-for-BFD-Development) in the BFD Wiki.

### Building the Project

The project includes various applications that can be built according to the guidelines in their respective directories. Detailed build instructions can be found in the BFD Wiki.

### Contributing changes

Contributions to the BFD are welcome from any party inside CMS.
Small changes like "good first issues" can be submitted for consideration without any additional process. This [LGTM resource](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data/?mode=list) provides candidates for "good first issues". 

Any [substantive change must go though an RFC process](#proposing-substantive-changes) before work on the change itself can start.

Any code changes should be properly commented and accompanied by appropriate unit and integration test as per [DASG Engineering Standards](https://github.com/CMSgov/cms-oeda-dasg/blob/master/policies/engineering_standards.md).

**FAQ**

Q: What kind of changes don't require an RFC?

A: In general bug fixes and small changes that do not affect behavior or meaning. If you're unsure please quickly ask in the [#bfd](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C010WDXAZFZ) channel or in the Scrum of Scrums meeting. If your PR involves a substantial change, it will be rejected and you will be asked to go through the RFC process.

Q: How do I know what "first issues" are up for grabs? 

A: First issues are tracked on the BFD's Jira board with the "Good_First_Issue" label: <https://jira.cms.gov/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20BFD%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20Good_First_Issue>

### Workflow and Branching

BFD follows the GitHub Flow Workflow:
1. Fork the project
2. Check out the `master` branch
3. Create a feature branch
4. Write code and tests for your change
5. From your branch, make a pull request against `CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data/master`
6. Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
7. Wait for your change to be merged into the main repository
8. Delete your feature branch

### Testing Conventions

All code changes should be properly tested with appropriate unit and integration tests. Follow the testing guidelines specific to each application within the BFD ecosystem.

### Coding Style and Linters

For tips on how to adhere to the code documentation rules and general style tips, check out the [BFD Style Guide](https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data/blob/master/docs/style/style-guide.md).

Each application has its own linting and testing guidelines. Lint and code tests are run on each commit, so linters and tests should be run locally before committing.

### Proposing substantive changes

Substantive changes need to go through a design process involving the core team.
Opening an RFC provides a path for this inclusion and process.
Start an RFC by copying the file [`rfcs/0000-template.md`](rfcs/0000-template.md) to `rfcs/0000-<my idea>.md` and fill in the details. 
Open a PR using the RFC template [submit a pull request](#opening-a-pr).
The RFC will remain open for a 2 week period, at the end of which a go/no-go meeting will be held.
If approved by at least two core team members and there are no outstanding reservations, the RFC will be accepted.
Once accepted the author of the RFC and their team can scope the work within their regular process. Link or reference the RFC in the related JIRA ticket.
The core team will respond with design feedback, and the author should be prepared to revise it in response.

**FAQ**

Q: What qualifies as a substantive change?

A: There is no strict definition, however examples of substantive changes are:

1. Any change to or addition of an API endpoint (either URL or response) that is not a bug fix.
2. Changes that affect the ingestion of data into the BFD (the ETL process). 
3. Changes that significantly alter the structure of the codebase.


Q: What if I'm not sure if I need an RFC?

A: Reach out to the [#bfd](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C010WDXAZFZ) channel or ask in the Scrum of Scrums meeting and see what the BFD team thinks.


Q: How should I prepare for an RFC?

A: Bring the idea to the [#bfd](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C010WDXAZFZ) channel or the Scrum of Scrums meeting and talk it over with the core team.


Q: What if my RFC is not accepted?

A: It will be closed, but can be reopened if it is updated to address the items that prevented it's acceptance.


Q: What if my team doesn't have the resources to implement our accepted RFC? 

A: Anyone can coordinate with you and the core team to take over the work. 

### Getting started

Going to work on this project? Great! There are currently two documented methods for getting a local environment up and running to get you setup for development. 

[Getting started on BFD](README.md) 

#### Opening A PR

To contribute work back to the BFD your branch must be pushed to the `CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data` repository.
```
git push origin <your username>/<your feature name>
# To make sure "origin" points to CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data run
# git remote -v
# if a different remote points to CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data
# replace "origin" with that remotes name in the origional command
```
In order to obtain permission to do this contact a github administrator or reach out on [#bfd](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C010WDXAZFZ).
Once pushed, [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and use this [PR template](https://github.com/CMSgov/cms-oeda-dasg) found in .github

Please fill out each section of the body of the PR or quickly justify why the section does not apply to this particular change.
Reviewers will automatically be suggested or requested based on the projects CODEOWNERS file, feel free to add other reviewers if desired.
Once all automated checks pass and two reviewers have approved your pull request, a code owner from the core team will do a final review and make the decision to merge it in or not.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out on the [#bfd](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C010WDXAZFZ) channel in CMS slack!

### Writing Pull Requests

Comments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.
Files should be exempt of trailing spaces.

We adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit messages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80 columns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).

module-name: One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)

Problem
Explain the context and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be thought of being the motivation for your change.

Solution
Describe the modifications you've done.

Result
What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.

Some important notes regarding the summary line:
- workflows Describe what was done; not the result
- workflows Use the active voice
- workflows Use the present tense
- workflows Capitalize properly
- workflows Do not end in a period â€” this is a title/subject
- workflows Prefix the subject with its scope

### Reviewing Pull Requests

The repository on GitHub is kept in sync with an internal repository. For the most part this process should be transparent to the project users, but it does have some implications for how pull requests are merged into the codebase.

When you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the project community, and once the changes are approved, your commits will be merged into the system for additional testing. Once the changes are merged internally, they will be pushed back to GitHub.

This process means that the pull request will not be merged in the usual way. Instead a member of the project team will post a message in the pull request thread when your changes have made their way back to GitHub, and the pull request will be closed.

The changes in the pull request will be collapsed into a single commit, but the authorship metadata will be preserved.

**FAQ**

Q: What if the core team rejects my PR?

A: The BFD core team will commit to never rejecting a PR without providing a path forward. The developer who put up the PR should review any feedback, and discuss with their product manager the scope of the work that is now outstanding.
