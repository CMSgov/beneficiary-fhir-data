# `bfd_server_error_alerts` Diagram

This subdirectory contains the Python source code for generating the Graphviz diagram embedded in the `server-alarms` Terraservice `README`.

This uses a library known as [`diagrams`](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams) to easily generate a graph representing cloud architecture.
