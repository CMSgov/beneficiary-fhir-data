# This is very a simple script that assists with reading and decrypting
# encrypted yaml files. As of this writing, this targets the ansible-vault
# encryption mechanism, and depends on access to the appropriate SSM
# Parameter Store hierarchy to resolve the password.
# This is intended for use in local development as well as by automated
# terraform worke flows that incorporate an external data source:
# https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/external/latest/docs/data-sources/data_source
#
# Globals:
#   EYAML_FILE formatted "$1" positional argument for relative file resolution
#   SSM_VAULT_PASSWORD_PATH SSM Hierarchy containing the ansible vault password
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 is the desired eyaml file that can be entered with or without qualifying path or
#      suffix. `values/foo.eyaml`, `values/foo`, `foo.eyaml` and `foo` are equivalent.
EYAML_FILE="$(basename "$1" | sed 's/\.eyaml//').eyaml"
