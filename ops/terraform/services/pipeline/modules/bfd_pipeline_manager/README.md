# `bfd_pipeline_manager` Sub-module

This submodule defines a Lambda and its corresponding infrastructure. This Lambda,
`bfd-${env}-pipeline-manager`, "manages" the BFD Pipeline Terraservice; it is invoked when new files
are created in the `env`'s corresponding S3 pipeline/ETL bucket at specific paths:

- `Synthetic/Incoming/`
- `Synthetic/Done/`
- `Incoming/`
- `Done/`

Objects uploaded to or moved to these paths in the ETL bucket will invoke this Lambda, which will
then determine if the BFD CCW Pipeline should be started or not. This depends on a few factors:

- If the file was uploaded to either of the `Incoming` folders, and there is no _ongoing_ data load
  for that file's "group", the `bfd-deploy-pipeline-terraservice` Jenkins pipeline is started using
  the `bfd-job-broker` with the arguments set to _create_ the CCW Pipeline instance
- Else, if the file was uploaded to either of the `Done` folders, there is no files in the
  corresponding `Incoming` folder, and all non-optional RIF files are present in the `Done` folder,
  the `bfd-deploy-pipeline-terraservice` Jenkins pipeline is started using the `bfd-job-broker` with
  the arguments set to _destroy_ the CCW Pipeline instance

In short, this Lambda indirectly invokes a Jenkins pipeline that will either _create_ or _destroy_
the CCW Pipeline instance for the current `env`, thus ensuring the CCW Pipeline instance is only
running when there is data queued up for load into that `env`. As a side effect of using Terraform
to do this management, the `pipeline` Terraservice will be _continuously deployed_ whenever the CCW
Pipeline instance needs to start or stop.

Note that the branch from which this Lambda/module was deployed from remains consistent, such that
whatever branch this module was deployed from will be the branch variant of the
`bfd-deploy-pipeline-terraservice` that is invoked. For established environments, this will
generally remain `master`, but this allows for consistency when using ephemeral environments that
may be based upon non-`master` branches.
