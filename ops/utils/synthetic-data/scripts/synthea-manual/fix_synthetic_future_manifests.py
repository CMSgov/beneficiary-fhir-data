    Script for fixing the manifests for each synthetic future data folder
    which has been renamed by rename_synthetic_future_folders_aws.py. The
    manifest needs to have the same timestamp as the folder, so this
    makes all the manifests line up with the folder timestamp. This script 
    is a bit rough as it's somewhat of a short-term
    hack until the generation script is fixed to handle generating things
    correctly in the first place.
