# Report: EBS IOPS

This is a one-off script created for analyzing historical IOPS usage of our EBS volumes.
It was originally created to help in the analysis for the "should we switch to RDS Aurora?" proposal/RFC.

Keeping it around not because I expect it to be needed again as-is,
  but instead because it's a useful example of using Python's boto library to pull data from AWS.
