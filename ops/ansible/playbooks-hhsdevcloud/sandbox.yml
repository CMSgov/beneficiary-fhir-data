##
# Manages the rollout/upgrade of Blue Button API systems.
#
# **Backend - Database Server**: The DB server used in the Blue Button API's
# backend is currently just an Amazon RDS instance. This script does not 
# currently support updating this DB; any such updates would have to be 
# performed manually.
#
# **Backend - FHIR Servers**: The FHIR servers used in the Blue Button API's
# backend are deployed via a phased rollout/rollover approach. This approach
# ensures that user requests are not dropped during upgrades. This script does
# not currently support rollbacks if problems are encountered during upgrades;
# it is instead strongly recommended that developers/admins "roll forward" to
# resolve such problems.
#
# **Backend - ETL Server**: The ETL server used in the Blue Button API's 
# backend is deployed using a blue-green strategy. This strategy ensures that
# any in-progress data set processing is completed normally, but that all 
# further data set processing is handled by the new instance. Again, 
# developers/admins are encouraged to "roll forward" to resolve any problems
# encountered during deployment.

# Configure the new ETL server, starting the new ETL service.
