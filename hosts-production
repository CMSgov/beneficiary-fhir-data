# Our security policies mandate individual user accounts for everyone; we can't 
# specify a shared username that all Ansible connections will use. Accordingly,
# users must havee an SSH alias for these systems in their `~/.ssh/config` 
# file, which must define the `HostName` `User`, and `IdentityFile` for each 
system.
