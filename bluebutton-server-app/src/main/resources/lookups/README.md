# Diagnosis and Procedure Code Lookups File


* The CCW Diagnosis and Procedure Code/Display files are NOT being downloaded from a site when this application is being built.  These files change once a year and are stored on the GDIT mainframe for now.  We will need to determine how to best update these files (DGNS_CD.txt & PRCDR_CD.txt) once a year.
