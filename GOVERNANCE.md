# Governance 
<!-- TODO: Starting at Tier 3 GOVERNANCE.md has basic language about early community governance, how the project make decisions, and how contributors are elevated through the leadership process if any (e.g. joining teams, getting maintainer status, etc...)--> 
 This project is governed by our [Community Guidelines](COMMUNITY_GUIDELINES.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
