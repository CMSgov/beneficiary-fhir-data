Beneficiary FHIR Data System (BFD)
====================================

## About

This project contains modules and documentation in support of the Beneficiary FHIR Data (BFD) Server. 
The BFD Server is an API designed to serve Medicare beneficiaries' demographic, enrollment, and claims data using the [HL7® FHIR® Standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) format.

It's the vision of this project to provide a comprehensive, performant, and trustworthy platform to transform the way that the CMS enterprise shares and uses data.
This aligns with the overarching mission to enable the CMS Enterprise to drive innovation in data sharing so that beneficiaries and their healthcare partners have the data they
need to make informed decisions about their healthcare.

The high-level purpose and location of each piece of the project is listed below.

* [apps](apps) - contains the source code for each of the deployed BFD applications
  * [bfd-data-fda](apps/bfd-data-fda) - downloads FDA Drug code names into a resource used during BFD drug code name lookups
  * [bfd-data-npi](apps/bfd-data-npi) - downloads CMS NPI (National Provider Identification) names into a resource used during BFD NPI lookups
  * [bfd-db-migrator](apps/bfd-db-migrator) - application for safely applying schema updates and data migrations to the BFD database
  * [bfd-model](apps/bfd-model) - contains data models used throughout the BFD project
  * [bfd-pipeline](apps/bfd-pipeline) - application for loading claim data from the provider into the BFD database
  * [bfd-server](apps/bfd-server) - application for serving the BFD database data in FHIR format to users via the BFD API
  * [bfd-shared-test-utils](apps/bfd-shared-test-utils) - utilities shared across BFD projects used in testing
  * [bfd-shared-utils](apps/bfd-shared-utils) - utilities shared across BFD projects used in the application code
  * [utils](apps/utils) - non-application scripts used for testing, development, and database management
* [insights](insights) - contains documentation and resources for maintaining BFD Insights, a platform using AWS Cloudwatch to provide analytics and metrics for BFD applications
* [ops](ops) - contains the scripts and resources required for packaging and deploying BFD applications
* [rfcs](docs/rfcs) - holds the archived and active RFC (Request for Comment) documents for BFD
* [runbooks](docs/runbooks) - contains maintenance documents for executing and troubleshooting various BFD scenarios
