# Beneficiary FHIR Data System (BFD)

## About the Project
This project contains modules and documentation in support of the Beneficiary FHIR Data (BFD) Server. 
The BFD Server is an API designed to serve Medicare beneficiaries' demographic, enrollment, and claims data using the [HL7® FHIR® Standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) format.

## Core Team
Although this is a public repo, contributing to the BFD is for CMS-approved contributors only, not outside contributors.
For more information about our BFD teams, see [COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md)

## Project Vision
It's the vision of this project to provide a comprehensive, performant, and trustworthy platform to transform the way that the CMS enterprise shares and uses data.

## Agency Mission
This aligns with the overarching mission to enable the CMS Enterprise to drive innovation in data sharing so that beneficiaries and their healthcare partners have the data they need to make informed decisions about their healthcare.
