## Motivation
[Motivation]: #motivation

To increase the usability of the API
provided by the BFD
by enabaling searching for beneficiaries
by certain attributes.
In this case
their Part D entrollment status.

## Proposed Solution
[Proposed Solution]: #proposed-solution

### Patient centric interface

`/Patient/?ptdcntrct<month_code>=<contract id>`

returns a set of patient resources
that have that `contract_id` for that `month_code`.

`/Patient/?Coverage.identifier=https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/ptdcntrct<month_code>|<contract_id>`

Same return value.

### Coverage centric interface

`/Coverage/?identifier=https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/ptdcntrct<month_code>|<contract_id>`

returns a set of Coverage resources
for that `contract_id` and `month_code`.
Each resource would contain a
`beneficiary` entry
with a `Patient/<fhir_id>` entry.
