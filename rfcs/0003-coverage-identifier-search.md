## Motivation
[Motivation]: #motivation

To increase the usability of the API
provided by the BFD
by enabaling searching for beneficiaries
by certain attributes.
In this case
their Part D entrollment status.

## Proposed Solution
[Proposed Solution]: #proposed-solution

### Patient centric interface

`v1.1/fhir/Patient/?ptdcntrct<month_code>=<contract id>`

returns a [bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html) of [patient resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html)
that have that `contract_id` for that `month_code`.



### Proposed Solution: Detailed Design
[Proposed Solution: Detailed Design]: #proposed-solution-detailed-design

#### Implementation Goals

- a pattern for data filters
- low risk of change to current external contract
	- do partners currently expect a `Patient` call without a `patient_id` parameter to error?

#### valid parameters

> Monthly Part D Contract Number: The Part D contract number for the  beneficiaryâ€™s Part D plan for a given month. CMS assigns an identifier  to each contract that a Part D plan has with CMS.

[bb docs on part D contract id](https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/ptdcntrct01/)

https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/ptdcntrct01 is a valid coding

[example coverage response with codes](https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data/blob/b541b973bf21c925f80df9c154263eb0b6ae4483/apps/bfd-server/bfd-server-war/src/test/resources/endpoint-responses/coverageSearchByPatientId.json#L588-L660)

## Future Possibilities
[Future Possibilities]: #future-possibilities

`/Patient/?Coverage.identifier=https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/ptdcntrct<month_code>|<contract_id>`

Same return value.

### Coverage centric interface

`/Coverage/?identifier=https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/ptdcntrct<month_code>|<contract_id>`

returns a set of Coverage resources
for that `contract_id` and `month_code`.
Each resource would contain a
`beneficiary` entry
with a `Patient/<fhir_id>` entry.
