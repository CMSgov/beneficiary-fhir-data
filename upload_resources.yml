##
# Uploads local resources that will be used during the deployment (e.g. WARs)
# to S3, for later retrieval by the plays/tasks that need them.
# 
# Design Note: Technically, this isn't really necessary, as the individual 
# plays/tasks could manage this themselves. However, uploads are finicky so
# I've found that it's best to centralize them for stuff like this. It makes it
# simpler to disable or rework, when needed.
