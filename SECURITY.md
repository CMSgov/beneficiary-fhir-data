# Security and Responsible Disclosure Policy 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is committed to ensuring the security of the American public by protecting their information from unwarranted disclosure. We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they have discovered so we can fix them and keep our users safe. We developed our disclosure policy to reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share their expertise with us in good faith. 
 
 *Submit a vulnerability:* Vulnerability reports can be submitted through [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/cms-vdp). Reports may be submitted anonymously. If you share contact information, we will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days. 
 
 Review the HHS Disclosure Policy and websites in scope:

 This policy describes *what systems and types of research* are covered under this policy, *how to send* us vulnerability reports, and *how long* we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.
