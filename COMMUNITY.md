### Principles
These principles guide our data, product, and process decisions, architecture, and approach.

- Practice empathy and humility.
- Assume competence in your colleagues, clients and the public.
- Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work for the public.
- Listen carefully and actively.
- Ask questions, and seek to understand your partners&#39; context.
- Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
- Treat other people&#39;s identities and cultures with respect. Make an effort to say people&#39;s names correctly and refer to them by their chosen pronouns.

## Community Guidelines
We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.
