# Ansible Hosts & Groups Inventory
#
# Our security policies mandate individual user accounts for everyone; we can't
# specify a shared username that all Ansible connections will use. Accordingly,
# users must have an SSH alias for these systems in their `~/.ssh/config`
# file, which must define the `HostName` `User`, and `IdentityFile` for each
# system. For the Jenkins server's SSH config, update the
# `templates/ssh_config.j2` template file and run the
# `bluebutton-ansible-playbooks-data` job with `bootstrap_jenkins` enabled,
# which will apply the SSH config changes to the Jenkins system itself.
