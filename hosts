# Ansible Hosts & Groups Inventory
#
# Our security policies mandate individual user accounts for everyone; we can't
# specify a shared username that all Ansible connections will use. Accordingly,
# users must have an SSH alias for these systems in their `~/.ssh/config`
# file, which must define the `HostName` `User`, and `IdentityFile` for each
# system.
