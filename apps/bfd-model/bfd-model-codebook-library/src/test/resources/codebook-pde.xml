        <description>
            <p>The unique CCW identifier for a beneficiary.</p>
            <p>The CCW assigns a unique beneficiary identification number to each individual who receives Medicare and/or Medicaid, and uses that number to identify an individual’s records in all CCW data files (e.g., Medicare claims, MAX claims, MDS assessment data).</p>
            <p>This number does not change during a beneficiary’s lifetime and each number is used only once.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This is a CCW-derived field that indicates the benefit phase in which the prescription likely occurred. This is done by ordering the beneficiary's claims by their dates of service and then comparing the cost of those PDEs to the benefit structure for the beneficiary’s plan.</p>
            <p>The benefit phase is described using a two-digit code. The first digit indicates the benefit phase immediately before the prescription was filled, and the second digit indicates the benefit phase immediately after the prescription was filled. The two digits are necessary because the benefit phases depend on specific dollar amounts and often do not split exactly between prescription fills; that is, a particular PDE may “straddle” more than one benefit phase. For example, “DD” indicates that the beneficiary was in the deductible phase of the benefit both before and after filling the prescription, but “PI” indicates that this PDE occurred partly in the pre-ICL phase and partly in the coverage gap.</p>

            <p>Some non-standard combinations of benefit phases might appear, particularly if a beneficiary changed plans during the year.</p>
            <p>The CCW creates this variable based on the beneficiary’s plan benefit package at the time of the prescription was filled (using the Part D contract and plan of record which appear in the CCW Master Beneficiary Summary A/B/D file).

            <p>Investigators who wish to obtain Pharmacy Characteristics files must choose between the pharmacy IDs on the PDE (variable called the service provider ID [SRVC_PRVDR_ID]), or the CCW_PHARM_ID (or, starting in 2014, the proprietary NCPDP_ID) that will allow linkage between the PDE and Pharmacy Characteristics Files.</p>
            <p>Beginning with 2014 data, the NCPDP_ID is used in place of the CCW_PHARM_ID.</p>
            <p>Researchers who received CCW data from 2006-2013 and wish to identify the NCPDP_ID associated with the CCW_PHARM_ID may request the "Pharmacy Bridge File", which is designed for this purpose.</p>
            <p>This variable is populated by linking the service provider identification number (SRVC_PRVDR_ID) from the source PDE to the proprietary National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) dataQ™ Database. The variable is populated for every PDE that could be linked to the NCPDP pharmacy data for that year, and will occasionally be null if there was no conclusive link between the service provider identification number in the source PDE data and the provider identification numbers in the NCPDP pharmacy data.</p>
            <p>This variable usually represents a unique pharmacy entity, which historically was a retail store. However, as the pharmacy industry has evolved, some retail stores have added other lines of business, such as filling prescriptions for long-term care facilities. In these cases, the pharmacy can ask NCPDP to issue them more than one identification number to keep the billing separate for their multiple lines of business.</p>

            <p>Beginning with 2014 data, this variable has been retired and researchers may obtain both the actual prescriber identifier (PRSCRBR_ID) and the CCW Prescriber Characteristics File. As of May 2013, the PRSCRBR_ID is always populated with the National Provider Identifier (NPI).</p>
            <p>Researchers who received CCW data from 2006-2013 and wish to identify the HCIdea-assigned provider ID (HCID) and/or NPI associated with the CCW_PRSCRBR_ID may request the "Prescriber Bridge File", which is designed for this purpose.</p>
            <p>For 2006-2013, this variable is the CCW-assigned prescriber identifier that is populated by linking the PRSCRBR_ID from the PDE to the proprietary HCIdea Prescriber Database.</p>
            <p>HCIdea has prescriber information from a variety of data sources, including the NPPES directory (the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System, which assigns a unique NPI to each provider), the Drug Enforcement Administration (through data files known as the Controlled Substances Act Registrants), and SureScripts (a nationwide e-prescribing network). Using these input files, it was generally possible for CCW to identify a unique provider using an NPI, DEA number, and/or UPIN number.</p>
            <p>This variable is populated for every PDE that could be linked to a provider in the HCIdea database for that year. CCW_PRSCRBR_ID has a negative value when a conclusive link could not be found between the prescriber identification number in the source PDE data and the HCIdea database.</p>

            <p>This variable is the portion of the gross drug cost for the prescription drug fill that was covered by Part D’s catastrophic coverage.</p>
            <p>Under Part D, a beneficiary qualifies for catastrophic coverage when his/her true out-of-pocket (TrOOP) costs reach a specific dollar threshold (for example, the threshold was $4,550 in 2010). For prescriptions that were filled when a beneficiary was below the out-of-pocket threshold (OOPT), this field will contain a zero dollar amount. For prescriptions above the OOPT, this field will contain a positive dollar value. If a prescription crosses the threshold, then the portion of the gross drug cost that is above the threshold will appear in this field.</p>

            <p>This is the unique identification number assigned by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) to every licensed pharmacy in the United States and its territories.</p>
            <p>This field also enables linkage between pharmacies in the Part D Event (PDE) File and the CCW Pharmacy Characteristics File for 2014+.</p>
        </description>
        <comment>
            <p>This variable was new in 2014. The NCPDP_ID is used in place of the CCW_PHARM_ID in the Part D Pharmacy Characteristics File.</p>
            <p>Researchers who received CCW data from 2006-2013 and wish to identify the NCPDP_ID associated with the CCW_PHARM_ID may request the "Pharmacy Bridge File", which is designed for this purpose.</p>
            <p>Investigators who wish to obtain the CCW Pharmacy Characteristics files must choose between obtaining the pharmacy IDs on the PDE (variable called the service provider ID [SRVC_PRVDR_ID]), or the proprietary NCPDP_ID that will allow linkage between the PDE and Pharmacy Characteristics Files.</p>
            <p>The NCPDP_ID variable is populated by linking the service provider identification number (SRVC_PRVDR_ID) from the source PDE to the proprietary National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) dataQ™ Database. The variable is populated for every PDE that can be linked to the NCPDP pharmacy data for that year, and will occasionally be null if there was no conclusive link between the service provider identification number in the source PDE data and the provider identification numbers in the NCPDP pharmacy data. Within the NCPDP database, this ID used to be called the NABP Number. NCPDP also enumerates licensed Alternate Dispensing Sites and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Providers.</p>
            <p>This variable usually represents a unique pharmacy entity, which historically was a retail store. However, as the pharmacy industry has evolved, some retail stores have added other lines of business, such as filling prescriptions for long-term care facilities. In these cases, the pharmacy can ask NCPDP to issue them more than one identification number to keep the billing separate for their multiple lines of business.</p>

            <p>Historically, a single individual prescriber might have had more than one type of identifier, and the PDEs that he/she prescribed may have more than one PRSCRBR_ID (e.g., the NPI could have appeared on some PDEs and the DEA number on others). The PRSCRBR_ID usually represents a unique individual prescriber (i.e., a prescribing provider), but can occasionally represent an entity or organization (e.g., a clinic or specialized unit of a hospital).</p>
            <p>From 2006 -2013, when CMS privacy restrictions prohibited release of this variable, the CCW created a unique CCW prescriber identifier by cross walking all of the possible identifiers for each prescriber and assigning a CCW_PRSCRBR_ID to represent an individual medical practitioner. This allowed PDE records that had the same prescriber but used a combination of different identifiers to be assigned the same identifier in the CCW files.</p>
            <p>From 2006 - 2013, the CCW_PRSCRBR_ID enabled linkage to the CCW Prescriber Characteristics File. For current years, the PRSCRBR_ID will link to the Prescriber Characteristics File. For 2006-2013, the CCW_PRSCRBR_ID may be obtained instead of (but not in addition to) the PRSCRBR_ID. The CCW_PRSCRBR_ID was retired after 2013.</p>

            <p>This variable may only be obtained if the investigator receives the prescriber identifier (PRSCRBR_ID instead of the unique CCW prescriber identifier [variable called CCW_PRSCRBR_ID], which was retired after 2013). The CCW creates the CCW_PRSCRBR_ID from the prescriber identifier (PRSCRBR_ID) variable on the original PDE.</p>
            <p>This field is not validated and does not always reliably describe the identification numbers found in the prescriber identifier field (PRSCRBR_ID).</p>
            <p>Investigators interested in linking the prescriber identifiers to cross-reference databases may find it helpful to know the type of variable that appears in this data field. The CCW has found it more accurate to perform testing on the PRSCRBR_ID variable itself to determine the variable type, rather than relying on the information in this field (note that for 2006-2013, CCW created a variable called PDE_PRSCRBR_ID_FRMT_CD to examine the format). The CCW methodology consists of examining the format and structure of the PRSCRBR_ID to determine whether the value appears to conform to the various types of ID.</p>
            <p>The formats of these variables are: • NPI format -- 10 numeric characters starting with ‘1’ or ‘2’ • DEA format -- 9 alpha-numeric characters with the first two being alpha and the last 7 being numeric • UPIN format -- 6 alpha-numeric characters with the first being alpha and the remaining 5 being numeric (note: the UPIN is a legacy identifier and should not be seen often in the current PDEs) • State license numbers – formats are highly variable A fair number of values in this data field that are not NPIs or DEAs may be invalid.</p>

            <p>This variable is the dollar amount that the beneficiary paid for the PDE without being reimbursed by a third party.</p>

This amount contributes to a beneficiary's true out-of-pocket (TrOOP) costs, but only if it is for a Part D-covered drug (i.e., spending on non-covered drugs does not count toward the TrOOP amount).</p>

        <comment>
            <p>Three other variables measure payments that are made on behalf of the beneficiary and reduce the amount that he/she would normally have to pay for the PDE: LICS_AMT (amount paid by Part D low-income subsidy), OTHER_TROOP_AMT (other third-party payments that count towards the TrOOP amount), and PLRO_AMT (other third-party payments that do not count towards the TrOOP amount).</p>
            <p>If you want to know the beneficiary’s total liability for the drug (i.e., the amount that the Part D plan did not cover), you must sum this variable and the 3 variables listed above.</p>

            <p>CMS requires Part D plans to have drug utilization management programs to encourage compliance with the formulary; this variable is designed to make it easier to monitor how well LTC pharmacies comply with formularies by making it easier to aggregate LTC prescriptions into 31-day equivalent prescriptions and thus compare pricing.</p>
            <p>Note that this variable is different than the days supply of the medication on the PDE (the DAYS_SUPLY_NUM variable).</p>
            <p>This variable was new in 2013 and required for all PDEs beginning on February 28, 2013.</p>

            <p>This is a CCW-derived field that indicates the cost-sharing tier in which the prescription was placed, according to the benefit structure and formulary for the beneficiary’s plan.</p>
            <p>If a product is part of two different tiers, this field is populated with the minimum tier value for the product.</p>
            <p>Starting in 2010, this variable is included in the Formulary file (rather than the PDE file).</p>

            <p>Part D plan sponsors submit the pricing, tiers, and formularies for their plan benefit packages to CMS via the Health Plan Management System (HPMS).</p>
            <p>This includes information on how many cost-sharing tiers each plan will use and the drugs that will be on each tier. The CCW creates this variable based on the beneficiary’s plan of record, which is identified using the Part D contract and plan benefit package of record (the PLAN_CNTRCT_REC_ID and PLAN_PBP_REC_ID variables). For a small number of beneficiaries, particularly those who changed plans around the time of the fill, the variable may not be an accurate reflection of whether the PDE was on a particular drug tier.</p>

            <p>This variable is the total cost of the prescription drug event and is taken directly from the original PDE. It is the sum of the following components:  The ingredient cost (INGRDNT_CST_PD_AMT),  The dispensing fee (DSPNSNG_FEE_PD_AMT),  The sales tax, if any (TOT_AMT_ATTR_SLS_TAX_AMT), and  The vaccine administration fee, if any (VCCN_ADMIN_FEE_AMT, included starting in 2010).</p>
            <p>This is the price paid for the drug at the point of sale (i.e., the pharmacy counter), and it does not include any rebates or discounts that the drug manufacturer provides directly to the Part D plan sponsor.</p>
