        <description>
            <p>The unique CCW identifier for a beneficiary.</p>
            <p>The CCW assigns a unique beneficiary identification number to each individual who receives Medicare and/ or Medicaid, and uses that number to identify an individual’s records in all CCW data files (e.g., Medicare claims, MAX claims, MDS assessment data).</p>
            <p>This number does not change during a beneficiary’s lifetime and each number is used only once.</p>
            <p>The BENE_ID is specific to the CCW and is not applicable to any other identification system or data source.</p>

            <p>The original source for this variable is the State Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) files that states submit to CMS. Those files are considered the “gold standard” for identifying dual eligibles because the information in them is used to determine the level of Medicare Part D low-income subsidies.</p>
            <p>Dual eligibles are often divided into “full duals” and “partial duals” based on the level of Medicaid benefits they receive. CMS generally considers beneficiaries to be full duals if they have values of 02, 04, or 08, and to be partial duals if they have values of 01, 03, 05, or 06. Partial duals sometimes divided into the QMB-only population (01) and all other partial duals (03, 05, or 06). There are different ways to classify dually eligible beneficiaries.</p>
            <p>Additional information regarding various ways to identify dually enrolled populations, refer to a CCW Technical Guidance document entitled: "Options in Determining Dual Eligibles".</p>
            <p>There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).</p>
