            <p>In some cases, the code may not be the actual state where the beneficiary resides. CMS obtains the mailing address used for cash benefits or the mailing address used for other purposes (for example, premium billing) from Social Security Administration (SSA) and Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) Beneficiary Record Systems.</p>

            <p>This variable indicates whether the beneficiary was entitled to Part A, Part B, or both for a given month.</p>
            <p>There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).</p>
            <p>The variable also indicates whether the beneficiary’s state of residence paid his/her monthly premium for Part B coverage (and Part A if necessary).</p>
            <p>State Medicaid programs can pay those premiums for certain dual eligibles; this action is called “buying in” and so this variable is the “buy-in code.”</p>

        <description>
            <p>This variable indicates the beneficiary’s Part D low-income subsidy cost sharing group for a given month (January). The Part D benefit requires enrollees to pay both premiums and cost-sharing, but the program also has a low-income subsidy (LIS) that covers some or all of those costs for certain low-income individuals, including deductibles and cost-sharing during the coverage gap.</p>

            <p>CMS identifies beneficiaries with fully-subsidized Part D coverage by looking for individuals that have a 01, 02, or 03 for the month.</p>
            <p>Other beneficiaries who are eligible for the LIS but do not receive a full subsidy have a 04, 05, 06, 07, or 08.</p>
            <p>The remaining values indicate that the individual is not eligible for subsidized Part D coverage.</p>
            <p>There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).</p>

            <p>This variable indicates the beneficiary’s Part D low-income subsidy cost sharing group for a given month (March). The Part D benefit requires enrollees to pay both premiums and cost-sharing, but the program also has a low-income subsidy (LIS) that covers some or all of those costs for certain low-income individuals, including deductibles and cost-sharing during the coverage gap.</p>

            <p>This variable indicates the beneficiary’s Part D low-income subsidy cost sharing group for a given month (September). The Part D benefit requires enrollees to pay both premiums and cost-sharing, but the program also has a low-income subsidy (LIS) that covers some or all of those costs for certain low-income individuals, including deductibles and cost-sharing during the coverage gap.</p>

            <p>This enhanced 5% sample is broader than the annual 5% sample (variable called FIVE_PERCENT_FLAG) because it includes all beneficiaries who were ever part of the 5% sample but had a HIC change that was not part of the sample. The "enhanced" indicator variable allows for longitudinal study of the 5% sample (i.e., once in, always in).</p>
            <p>CCW creates the 5% sample using standard CMS processes. The 5% random sample consists of people who had a Medicare beneficiary Health Insurance Claim number (HIC) equal to the Claim Account Number (CAN) plus Beneficiary Identity Code (BIC) (HIC=CAN+BIC) where the last two digits of the CAN are in the set {05, 20, 45, 70, 95}.</p>

            <p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has updated the Medicare enrollment source data for the Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF). As of March 2017, the MBSF includes Medicare enrollment information from the CMS Common Medicare Environment (CME) rather than the CMS Common Medicare Environment (CME). Data from the two sources was nearly identical. The CME improves the identification of Medicare Part B enrollment and also allows for more timely release of the MBSF.</p>
            <p>The universe of beneficiaries in the CME versus the EDB version of the MBSF are only slightly different.</p>

            <p>The sampling determination is made each year. It is possible that a beneficiary with a HIC change is part of the 5% one year but not the next. To identify these cases, the CCW includes the enhanced 5% sample indicator (see variable ENHANCED_FIVE_PERCENT_FLAG); all beneficiaries who are ever included in the 5% sample (1999+) are identified.</p>

            <p>This variable is created by taking the beneficiary race code that has historically been used by the Social Security Administration (and is in turn used in CMS’s enrollment data base) and applying an algorithm that identifies more beneficiaries as Hispanic or Asian.</p>
            <p>This algorithm was developed by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and is thus often referred to as the “RTI race code”.</p>
            <p>The algorithm classifies beneficiaries as Hispanic or Asian if their SSA race code equals 4 (Asian) or 5 (Hispanic), or if they have a first or last name that RTI determined was likely Hispanic or Asian in origin.</p>
            <p>The variable also incorporates CCW enhancements that reduce the number of beneficiaries with missing information.</p>

            <p>In some cases, the code may not be the actual state where the beneficiary resides. CMS obtains the mailing address used for cash benefits or the mailing address used for other purposes (for example, premium billing) from Social Security Administration (SSA) and Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) Beneficiary Record Systems.</p>
            <p>The coding system is the SSA system, not the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).</p>
