# DSL Based Code Generation Support Library

This project produces a jar file containing a small library of support classes
that are required to execute the code generated by the DSL code generation plugins.

Interfaces provided by this library provide hooks for modules that use the transformer to extend its behavior in a data
specific way.
They also decouple the plugin generator from dependencies on underlying technologies.
For example the RDA API used protobuf stubs that require dependencies not necessary for the plugin but that might be
necessary for extensions.

Interfaces include:

| Interface                | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `EnumStringExtractor`    | Interface for objects that can extract string values from enum values of a specific type.                        |
| `ExternalTransformation` | Functional interface for lambda expressions that perform any sort of user provided validation or transformation. |

Classes provided by this library include:

| Class              | Description                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DataTransformer`  | Class used by the generated transformer classes to perform the actual data validation and copying.                             |
| `RifObjectWrapper` | Wrapper class used when transforming RIF data sets to provide methods for accessing individual fields within each line of CSV. |
