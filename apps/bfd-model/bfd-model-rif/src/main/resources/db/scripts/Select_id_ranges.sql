/*
 * Queries for finding the ID ranges of our synthetic data, developed around 2021-05-20.
 * 
 * It's worth noting that this general class of problem is commonly referred to as a "gaps and
 * islands problem" and you can search for solutions to it using that term. The queries here were
 * derived from this particular Stack Overflow answer, though:
 * <https://stackoverflow.com/a/17046749>.
 * 
 * This was definitely a bit of a journey: careful readers will note that the queries used evolved
 * over time, as more was discovered about the data and as techniques were refined. Main takeaways:
 * 
 * 1. Our ID ranges have lots of gaps, and thus "take up" more ID space than needed.
 *     * We only have 1,539,848 total synthetic claims, but use ID ranges of -1 through
 *       -100,000,000,000 and 1,145,251,452 through 5,114,848,764.
 * 2. The prod-sbx environment also has some or all of the "random" sample data loaded.
 *     * There are definitely "random" benes there. Not sure about claims, though. Certainly not
 *       for all of the claim types (as evidenced by the claim types I didn't have to do filtering
 *       for, below).
 * 3. A quick peek at "claimGroupId" shows that those values are also all over the place.
 * 4. Given that "claimId" is a `varchar(15)` column and we're only up to numbers that use thirteen
 *    of those characters, we have plenty of remaining room there.
 * 5. Given that "claimGroupId" is a `numeric(12,0)` and the max value just for "CarrierClaims" is
 *    99,999,991,267, we're basically out of room there.
 *
 * These queries are intended to be run manually, by copy-pasting them into an interactive `psql`
 * session, or somesuch.
