/*
 * Reverts the original version of the V21 migration, which was done in a developer
 * experimental branch, but didn't get into the master branch.
 *
 * Note: In general, this is a bad idea, but another V21 migration made it into
 * production, so removing this migration was thought as the best fix. See the v19 goof
 * for a similar situation.
