/*
 * This migration adds a message_errors table for tracking messages that resulted in
 * an error during the message ingestion process via the gRPC pipeline job.  This table will
 * provide a means to store the instigating data so it can be reviewed and troubleshooted.
 *
 * Keeping messages that generated errors in a separate persistent table will prevent it
 * from being lost due to subsequent claim updates that may clear the error, thus
 * making it more challenging to resolve the original issue.
