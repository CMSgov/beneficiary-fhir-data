-- NEW_SCHEMA_CREATE_VIEWS.SQL
--
-- This flyway script creates db views over new shema _new tables. This
-- allows the BFD services code, in particular the generated entity beans,
-- to point to updatable views instead of actual tables. This slight of hand
-- allows us to introduce a subsequent flyway script which will then get the
-- entire schema back to original table names, FK constraint names, index names,
-- etc. without any db downtime.
--
-- NOTE: for psql (Postgres) we create the view 'with check option' which
--       enables the view to be updatable.
