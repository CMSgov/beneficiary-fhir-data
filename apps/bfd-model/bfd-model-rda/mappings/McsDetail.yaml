      comment: 'First Procedure Code Modifier: This is first procedure modifier. In
        addition to the normal pricing criteria, the system allows claims examiners
        to use modifier codes to further qualify billed procedures. In some cases,
        the modifier requires special handling for pricing the service; in other cases,
        the modifier is used for further documentation of the performed service.

        The two types of modifiers, as referred to in the MCS, are statistical and
        pricing. There are two types of statistical modifiers. Some statistical modifiers
        are documentation modifiers and do not affect pricing although they may affect
        processing. Other statistical modifiers affect pricing by causing the established
        reasonable charge or fee to be modified in the same way every time. In both
        cases, statistical modifiers are not established on the procedure or pricing
        files as part of the procedure code key. On the other hand, pricing modifiers
        are considered by the system as part of the seven-digit procedure code key
        and are used for obtaining established reasonable charge or fee amounts. The
        reasonable charge or fee amounts for procedure codes with pricing modifiers
        are established independently of the same procedure without the modifier.

        This field may contain multiple procedure code modifiers or spaces. A procedure
