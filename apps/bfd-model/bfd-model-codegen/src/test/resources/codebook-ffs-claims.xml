            <p>Effective with Version 'J', the field was expanded on the NCH record to 2 bytes, With his expansion, the NCH will no longer use the character values to represent the official two byte values sent in by NCH since 4/2002. During the Version J conversion, all character values were converted to the two byte values.</p>
            <p>On 4/1/02, this field was expanded to two bytes to accommodate new values. The NCH Nearline file did not expand the current 1-byte field but instituted a crosswalk of the 2-byte field to the 1-byte character value.</p>

            <p>The present on admission (POA) indicator code associated with the diagnosis E codes (principal and secondary).</p>
            <p>In response to the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, CMS began to distinguish between hospitalization diagnoses that occurred prior to versus during the admission. The objective was to eventually not pay hospitals more if the patient acquired a condition (e.g., infection) during the admission. This present on admission (POA) field is used to indicate whether the diagnosis was present on admission.</p>

            <p>This field can be used in determining the "type of bill" for an institutional claim. Often type of bill consists of a combination of two variables: the facility type code (variable called CLM_FAC_TYPE_CD) and the service classification type code (CLM_SRVC_CLSFCTN_TYPE_CD). This variable serves as the optional third component of bill type, and it is helpful for distinguishing between final, interim, or RAP (request for anticipated payment) claims - which is particularly helpful if you receive claims that are not "final action".</p>
            <p>Many different types of services can be billed on a Part A or Part B institutional claim, and knowing the type of bill helps to distinguish them. The type of bill is the concatenation of three variables : the facility type (CLM_FAC_TYPE_CD), the service classification type code (CLM_SRVC_CLSFCTN_TYPE_CD), and the claim frequency code (CLM_FREQ_CD).</p>

            <p>This field was put on all institutional claim types but data did not start coming in on OP/HHA/Hospice until 4/1/02. Prior to 4/1/02, data only came in Inpatient/SNF claims.</p>
            <p>Effective 4/1/02, this field was also expanded to two bytes to accommodate new values.</p>
            <p>The NCH Nearline file did not expand the current 1-byte field but instituted a crosswalk of the 2-byte field to the 1-byte character value. See table of code for the crosswalk.</p>
            <p>NOTE3: Effective with Version 'J', the field has been expanded on the NCH claim to 2 bytes. With this expansion the NCH will no longer use the character values to represent the official two byte values being sent in by NCH since 4/2002.</p>
            <p>During the Version 'J' conversion, all character values were converted to the two byte values.</p>

            <p>Bundling payment for services that patients receive across a single episode of care, such as heart bypass surgery or a hip replacement, is one way to encourage doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to work together to better coordinate care for patients.</p>
            <p>Under the Model 4 BPCI pilot, CMS will reimburse qualified acute care hospitals a blended payment for hospital inpatient care and physician services connected with a single episode of care. This will occur in association with inpatient hospital claims that the BPCI participating hospital will bill to their jurisdictional A/B MAC as type of bill 11X claims.</p>

            <p>Medicare establishes a daily payment amount to reimburse IPPS hospitals for certain “pass-through” expenses, such as capital-related costs, direct medical education costs, kidney acquisition costs for hospitals that are renal transplant centers, and bad debts.</p>

            <p>To determine the total of the pass-through payments for a hospitalization, this field should be multiplied by the claim Medicare utilization day count (CLM_UTLZTN_DAY_CNT).

            <p>The Medicare claim payment amount.</p>
            <p>For hospital services, this amount does not include the claim pass-through per diem payments made by Medicare. To obtain the total amount paid by Medicare for the claim, the pass-through amount (which is the daily per diem amount) must be multiplied by the number of Medicare-covered days (i.e., multiply the CLM_PASS_THRU_PER_DIEM_AMT by the CLM_UTLZTN_DAY_CNT), and then added to the claim payment amount (this field).</p>
            <p>For non-hospital services (SNF, home health, hospice, and hospital outpatient) and for other non-institutional services (Carrier and DME), this variable equals the total actual Medicare payment amount, and pass-through amounts do not apply.</p>
            <p>For Part B non-institutional services (Carrier and DME), this variable equals the sum of all the line item-level Medicare payments (variable called the LINE_NCH_PMT_AMT).</p>

        <description>
            <p>The number used to determine a transfer adjusted case mix index for capital, under the prospective payment system (PPS). The number is determined by multiplying the Diagnosis Related Group Code (DRG) weight times the discharge fraction.</p>
            <p>Medicare assigns a weight to each DRG to reflect the average cost of caring for patients with the DRG compared to the average of all types of Medicare cases. This variable reflects the weight that is applied to the base payment amount.</p>
            <p>The DRG weights in this variable reflect adjustments due to patient characteristics and factors related to the stay. For example, payments are reduced for certain short stay transfers or where patients are discharged to post-acute care. Therefore, for a given DRG, the weight in this field may vary.</p>

            <p>This field, in combination with the facility type code (variable called CLM_FAC_TYPE_CD) indicates the “type of bill” for an institutional claim. Many different types of services can be billed on a Part A or Part B institutional claim, and knowing the type of bill helps to distinguish them. The type of bill is the concatenation of two variables: the facility type (CLM_FAC_TYPE_CD) and the service classification type code (CLM_SRVC_CLSFCTN_TYPE_CD).</p>

            <p>For Home Health prospective payment system (PPS) claims, the 'from' date and the 'thru' date on the RAP (Request for Anticipated Payment) initial claim match.</p>
            <p>The "thru" date on the claim may not always represent the last date of services, particularly for Home Health or Hospice care. To obtain the date corresponding with the cessation of services (or discharge date) use the discharge date from the claim (variable called NCH_BENE_DSCHRG_DT; note - this variable is not available for Home Health claims).</p>
            <p>For Part B non-institutional (Carrier and DME) services, this variable corresponds with the latest of any of the line-item level dates (i.e., in the Line File, it is the last CLM_THRU_DT for any line on the claim).

            <p>For Home Health prospective payment system (PPS) claims, the 'from' date and the ‘thru' date on the RAP (Request for Anticipated Payment) initial claim must always match.</p>
            <p>The "from" date on the claim may not always represent the first date of services, particularly for Home Health or Hospice care. To obtain the date corresponding with the onset of services (or admission date) use the admission date from the claim (variable called CLM_ADMSN_DT for IP, SNF and HH - and variable called CLM_HOSPC_START_DT_ID for Hospice claims).</p>
            <p>For Part B Non-institutional (Carrier and DME) services, this variable corresponds with the earliest of any of the line-item level dates (i.e., in the Line File, it is the first CLM_FROM_DT for any line on the claim). It is almost always the same as the CLM_THRU_DT; exception is for DME claims - where some services are billed in advance.</p>

            <p>The lower the number, the more important the diagnosis in the patient treatment/billing (i.e., ICD_DGNS_CD1 is considered the primary diagnosis).</p>

            <p>This is one component of the total amount that is payable on PPS claims, and reflects the IME (indirect medical education) payments for operating expenses (such as labor) for the claim.</p>
            <p>There are two types of IME amounts that may be payable for many PPS claims; the other type of IME payment is for the IME capital amount (variable called CLM_PPS_CPTL_IME_AMT). Both operating and capital IME payments are components of the PPS, as well as numerous other factors.</p>

            <p>The amount of money for which the intermediary determined the beneficiary is liable for the blood deductible.</p>
            <p>A blood deductible amount applies to the first 3 pints of blood (or equivalent units; applies only to whole blood or packed red cells - not platelets, fibrinogen, plasma, etc.</p>
            <p>which are considered biologicals). However, blood processing is not subject to a deductible. Calculation of the deductible amount considers both Part A and Part B claims combined.

            <p>CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maintainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs.</p>
            <p>Effective May 2007, no new UPINs (legacy numbers) will be generated for new physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.</p>

            <p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides for incentive payments for physicians and non-physician practitioners with specific primary specialty designations. In order to determine if the physician or non-physician is eligible for the incentive payment, the specialty code, NPI and name must be carried on the claims.</p>

        <comment>
            <p>This is the standardized amount as determined by PRICER software output. This amount is never used for payments. It is used for comparisons across different regions of the country for the value-based purchasing initiatives and for research. It is a standard amount, without the geographical payment adjustments and some of the other add-on payments that actually go to the hospitals.</p>
            <p>This field is new in October 2014. This field only applies to Inpatient claims.</p>
            <p>Note that an additional field is available that further adjusts the standard Medicare Payment amount by applying additional standardization requirements (e.g.</p>
            <p>sequestration).</p>
            <p>Refer to variable called the final standardized amount (FINL_STD_AMT).</p>

                <value code="CO">Contractual Obligations -- this group code should be used when a contractual agreement between the payer and payee, or a regulatory requirement, resulted in an adjustment.

                <value code="CR">Corrections and Reversals -- this group code should be used for correcting a prior claim. It applies when there is a change to a previously adjudicated claim.</value>
                <value code="OA">Other Adjustments -- this group code should be used when no other group code applies to the adjustment.</value>
                <value code="PI">Payer Initiated Reductions -- this group code should be used when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer (i.e., medical review or professional review organization adjustments).</value>

                <value code="CO">Contractual Obligations -- this group code should be used when a contractual agreement between the payer and payee, or a regulatory requirement, resulted in an adjustment.

                <value code="CR">Corrections and Reversals -- this group code should be used for correcting a prior claim. It applies when there is a change to a previously adjudicated claim.</value>
                <value code="OA">Other Adjustments -- this group code should be used when no other group code applies to the adjustment.</value>
                <value code="PI">Payer Initiated Reductions -- this group code should be used when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer (i.e., medical review or professional review organization adjustments).</value>

            <p>This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS PRICER software. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals [CAH]); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code '07' and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.</p>
            <p>Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.</p>

                <value code="CO">Contractual Obligations -- this group code should be used when a contractual agreement between the payer and payee, or a regulatory requirement, resulted in an adjustment.

                <value code="CR">Corrections and Reversals -- this group code should be used for correcting a prior claim. It applies when there is a change to a previously adjudicated claim.</value>
                <value code="OA">Other Adjustments -- this group code should be used when no other group code applies to the adjustment.</value>
                <value code="PI">Payer Initiated Reductions -- this group code should be used when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer (i.e., medical review or professional review organization adjustments).</value>
                <value code="PR">Patient Responsibility -- this group should be used when the adjustment represents an amount that should be billed to the patient or insured.

            <p>This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS PRICER software. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals [CAH]); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code '07' and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.</p>
            <p>Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.</p>

    <variable id="REV_CNTR_APC_HIPPS_CD" label="Revenue Center APC or HIPPS Code" shortName="APCHIPPS" longName="REV_CNTR_APC_HIPPS_CD" type="CHAR" length="5" source="NCH">
        <description>
            <p>This field contains one of two potential pieces of data; the Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) code or the Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) code, which corresponds with the revenue center line for the claim.</p>
            <p>The APC codes are used as the basis for payment for outpatient prospective payment (OPPS) service (e.g., Part B institutional).</p>
            <p>Some Part A claim types (e.g., home health and SNF) use resource groupings, which are similar to case-mix groups, as the basis for payment (e.g., HHRG, SNF RUGs).</p>
            <p>For home health (HH) claims, when the revenue center code (variable called REV_CNTR) is 0023, the HHRG is located in this field and is a HIPPS code. This field is only meaningful for a HH claim when CMS determines the claim should be paid using a different HIPPS code than the one submitted by the provider. When this happens, the revised HIPPS code (the one actually used for payment purposes) appears in this field and the original HIPPS code submitted by the provider remains in the HCPCS_CD field. Otherwise, this variable will always be null or have a value of “00000” for HH revenue center records.</p>
            <p>The resource utilization group for the particular revenue center is located in the data field called the APC or HIPPS code variable.</p>
            <p>The APC is a four byte field.</p>
            <p>The HIPPS code is a five byte field (such as 1AFKS).</p>

            <p>The APC field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer.</p>
            <p>The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code '07' and certain HCPCS.</p>
            <p>These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.</p>

            <p>This variable is the dollar amount the beneficiary is responsible for related to the deductible for blood products that appear on the revenue center record.</p>
            <p>A deductible amount applies to the first 3 pints of blood (or equivalent units; applies only to whole blood or packed red cells - not platelets, fibrinogen, plasma, etc. which are considered biologicals). However, blood processing is not subject to a deductible.</p>
            <p>Calculation of the deductible amount considers both Part A and Part B claims combined.</p>
            <p>The blood deductible does not count toward meeting the inpatient hospital deductible or any other applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts for which the patient is responsible.</p>

            <p>This variable is the beneficiary’s liability for coinsurance for the revenue center record.</p>
            <p>Beneficiaries only face coinsurance once they have satisfied Part B’s annual deductible, which applies to both institutional (e.g., HOP) and non-institutional (e.g., Carrier and DME) services.</p>
            <p>For most Part B services, coinsurance equals 20 percent of the allowed amount.</p>
            <p>The coinsurance amount is wage adjusted, based on the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) where the provider is located.</p>

            <p>This field will have either a zero (for services for which coinsurance is not applicable), a regular coinsurance amount (calculated on either charges or a fee schedule) or if subject to OP PPS the national coinsurance amount will be wage adjusted.

            <p>It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward.</p>
            <p>Data has been found in claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 because the Standard Systems have processed any claim coming in 7/00 and after, meeting the above criteria, through the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) regardless of the dates of service.</p>

            <p>To obtain the Medicare payment amount for the services reported on the revenue center record, it is more accurate to use a different variable called the revenue center Medicare provider payment amount (REV_CNTR_PRVDR_PMT_AMT).</p>

Effective 10/2005, only the payment indicator codes remain in this table and the status indicator is housed in a new field named: REV_CNTR_STUS_IND_CD (with the corresponding values in the new table: REV_CNTR_STUS_IND_TB).

            <p>It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward. Data has been found in claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 because the Standard Systems have processed any claim coming in 7/00 and after, meeting the above criteria, through the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) regardless of the dates of service.</p>

            <p>For SNF PPS claims (when revenue center code equals '0022'), CMS has developed a SNF PRICER to compute the rate based on the provider supplied coding for the MDS RUGS III group and assessment type (HIPPS code, stored in revenue center HCPCS code field).</p>
            <p>For OP PPS claims, CMS has developed a PRICER to compute the rate based on the Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC), discount factor, units of service and the wage index.</p>
            <p>Under HH PPS (when revenue center code equals '0023'), CMS has developed a HHA PRICER to compute the rate. On the RAP, the rate is determined using the case mix weight associated with the HIPPS code, adjusting it for the wage index for the beneficiary's site of service, then multiplying the result by 60% or 50%, depending on whether or not the RAP is for a first episode.</p>
            <p>On the final claim, the HIPPS code could change the payment if the therapy threshold is not met, or partial episode payment (PEP) adjustment or a significant change in condition (SCIC) adjustment.</p>
            <p>In cases of SCICs, there will be more than one '0023' revenue center line, each representing the payment made at each case-mix level.</p>
            <p>For IRF PPS claims (when revenue center code equals '0024'), CMS has developed a PRICER to compute the rate based on the HIPPS/CMG (HIPPS code, stored in revenue center HCPCS code field).</p>

            <p>This 2-byte indicator was added 10/2005 due to an expansion of a field that currently exist on the revenue center trailer. The status indicator is currently the 1st position of the Revenue Center Payment Method Indicator Code. The payment method indicator code is being split into two 2-byte fields (payment indicator and status indicator). The expanded payment indicator will continue to be stored in the existing payment method indicator field. The split of the current payment method indicator field is due to the expansion of both pieces of data from 1-byte to 2-bytes.</p>

            <p>This field appears on both the revenue center and base claim files.</p>
            <p>CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maintainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs.</p>
            <p>Effective May 2007, no new UPINs (legacy numbers) will be generated for new physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.</p>
