Sample Data
===========

This module contains and references test beneficiary enrollment and Medicare claims data that is used to verify the code correctly operates against the real data that it will encounter in production. All access to that test data is routed through the [StaticRifResource](./src/main/java/gov/cms/bfd/pipeline/sampledata/StaticRifResource.java) class, which can be inspected to review how that data is used.

The following test data is used:

* Hand-Written Test Data: The "`SAMPLE_A`" RIF files referenced in `StaticRifResources` were created by hand. These contain a single beneficiary record and one claim record per supported claim type.
* Randomly Generated Test Data: The "`SAMPLE_B`" RIF files referenced in `StaticRifResources` were generated by an automated program, as detailed in [fhir-test-data-random-documentation.pdf](./dev/fhir-test-data-random-documentation.pdf).
