"Identifying Partially-adjudicated Claims","To discriminate partially-adjudicated claims from adjudicated claims, the meta.tag key should be used. Status information in meta.tag is populated with values from the CodeSystem available at https://bluebutton.cms.gov/fhir/CodeSystem/Adjudication-Status"
"Utilizing FHIRPath","There are a wealth of FHIRPath implementations. A list of some are available at https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/FHIRI/pages/161060129/FHIRPath+Implementations , and this Data Dictionary utilizes FHIRPath.js, available at https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js"
"Handling arrays with FHIRPath","We recommend utilizing the cardinality field in order to determine if the evaluation of a FHIRPath expression may return multiple resources. If so, there are several options, such as modifying the FHIRPath to only return a single result (for example, Patient.address.state -> Patient.address[0].state), or manipulating the data after the expression has been evaluated."
"Bug Reports + Suggestions","Please either make a google group post or email the published email for the API that you received the data through, and we will be sure to look at it!"
"Utilizing Terminology Resources","The URLs available in the 'referenceTable' column point to CodeSystem resources that enumerate the potential values for a given field. Of note, these are only populated for CMS-specific terminology that would not be found elsewhere."
"Going from v2 -> v3 mappings","The 'ccwMapping' column aligns with the 'CCW Mapping' field in the v2 data dictionary. Not all data is stored the same way between CCW and the IDR. Monthly fields in BFD v2 are no longer represented in BFD v3 as discrete elements, but they can be derived. For example, the data represented by CST_SHR_GRP_CD_01 in BFD v2 is now represented by three discrete variables, and the applicability refers to the current state rather than a given month."
"Mapping from CCLF","The 'cclfMapping' column aligns with the 'CCLF Mapping' field in the v2 data dictionary. "
"Apparent errors in 'appliesTo' and 'sources'","The appliesTo and sources columns are sourced from source to target mapping files of BFD's upstream source. Because BFD's upstream source compiles information from multiple sources itself, there can be inconsistencies in availability of specific fields. BFD plans to make note of these inconsistencies over time."
