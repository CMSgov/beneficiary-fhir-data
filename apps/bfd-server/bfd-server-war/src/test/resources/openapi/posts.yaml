                    Fetch _Patient_ data using a FHIR _IdType_ identifier; an IdType
                    represents the logical identity for a resource, or as much of that
                    identity that is known. In FHIR, every resource must have a _logical ID_ which is
                    defined by the [FHIR specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/datatypes.html#id) as:
                    
                    `Any combination of upper or lower case ASCII letters ('A'..'Z', and 'a'..'z', numerals ('0'..'9'),
                    '-' and '.', with a length limit of 64 characters. (This might be an integer, an un-prefixed OID, UUID
                    or any other identifier pattern that meets these constraints.)`
                    
                    This class contains that logical ID, and can optionally also contain a relative or absolute URL
                    representing the resource identity; the following are all valid values for IdType, and all might
                    represent the same resource:
                      - `_id=567834`
                      - `_id=1234`

                    Only satisfy the Search if the Beneficiary's `last_updated` Date falls within a specified _DateRange_.
                    A _DateRange_ can be defined by providing less than `lt` and/or greater than `gt` values.
                    This parameter can be included in a request one or more times.
                    
                    Inexact timestamps are accepted, but not recommended, since the input will implicitly be converted to use the server's timezone.

                    Examples:
                      - `_lastUpdated=gt2023-01-02T00:00+00:00&_lastUpdated=lt2023-05-01T00:00+00:00` defines a range between two provided dates
                      - `_lastUpdated=gt2023-01-02T00:00+00:00` defines a range between the provided date and today
                      - `_lastUpdated=lt2023-05-01T00:00+00:00` defines a range from the earliest available records until the provided date

                    The _Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration_ (SAMHSA)
                    is the agency within the U.S. Department of HHS that leads public health efforts to advance the behavioral health of the nation.
                    Setting this flag to _true_, modifies the request to filter out all SAMSHA-related claims from the response.
                    _ClaimResponse_ doesn't contain any SAMHSA potential data. Due to the 1:1 relationship between _ClaimResponse_
                    and _Claim_, any ClaimResponse resource will be excluded when the associated Claim resource contains SAMHSA data.
                    
                    Example:
                      - `excludeSAMHSA=true`
                includeTaxNumbers:
                  type: string
                  description: |-
                    Setting this flag to _true_, provides tax number in the EOB transformed data for the response.
                    
                    Example:
                       - `includeTaxNumbers=true`
                service-date:
                  type: string
                  description: |-
                    Only satisfy the search request if a claim's date falls within a specified _DateRange_.
                    The _DateRange_ is defined by the claim's billing period, specifically the 
                    `Claim.billablePeriod.end`. A _DateRange_ can be further refined by providing 
                    less than `lt` and/or greater than `gt` values. This parameter can be included 
                    in a request one or more times.
                    
                    Examples:
                       - `service-date=gt2023-01-02&service-date=lt2023-05-01`
                       - `service-date=gt2023-01-02`
                       - `service-date=lt2023-05-01`

                    When fetching a _Bundle Response_ using pagination, this URL parameter represents an offset
                    (starting point) into the list of elements for the _Request_.
                    It is optional and defaults to 1 if not supplied.
                    A value 0 is not allowed and negative indices are not currently supported.
                    
                    Example:
                       - `startIndex=100`
                  format: int32
                  example: 100
                '_count':
                  description: |-
                    Provides the number of records to be used for pagination.

                    Examples:

                    One or more comma-delimited claim types that filters the response to contain only EoBs that include the specified claim types.
                    This is optional and defaults to `*` denoting all types.
                    Supported values for claim type:
                       - `*` all types (default)
                       - `carrier`

                    The _elements parameter consists of a comma-separated list of base element names. Only elements that are listed are to be returned.
                    Clients SHOULD list desired elements in a resource as part of
                    the list of elements. The list of elements does not apply to included resources.
                    Servers are not obliged to return just the requested elements; mandatory elements are returned whether
                    they are requested or not. Each value of the list may also be a period-separated path to a specified element.

                    Fetch _Patient_ data using a FHIR _identifier_; an identifier contains a set of values that
                    include the logical identity for a resource. In FHIR, the _identifier_ is a parent element

                    `A string, typically numeric or alphanumeric, that is associated with a single object or entity within a given system.
                    Typically, identifiers are used to connect content in resources to external content available in other frameworks or protocols.
                    Identifiers are associated with objects and may be changed or retired due to human or system process and errors.`
