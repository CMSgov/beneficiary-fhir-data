                    **NOTE: TO MAKE A REQUEST TO THIS ENDPOINT IT IS REQUIRED TO CHOOSE ONE OUT OF THE FOLLOWING THREE PARAMETERS AT A GIVEN TIME (_id, identifier, _has:Coverage.extension)**
                    
                    Fetch _Patient_ data using a FHIR _IdType_ identifier; an IdType
                    represents the logical identity for a resource, or as much of that
                    identity that is known. In FHIR, every resource must have a _logical ID_ which is
                    defined by the [FHIR specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/datatypes.html#id) as:
                    
                    `Any combination of upper or lower case ASCII letters ('A'..'Z', and 'a'..'z', numerals ('0'..'9'),
                    '-' and '.', with a length limit of 64 characters. (This might be an integer, an un-prefixed OID, UUID
                    or any other identifier pattern that meets these constraints.)`
                    
                    This class contains that logical ID, and can optionally also contain a relative or absolute URL
                    representing the resource identity; the following are all valid values for IdType, and all might
                    represent the same resource:
                      - `_id=567834`
                      - `_id=1234`
                  example: "567834"
                _lastUpdated:

                    Only satisfy the Search if the Beneficiary's `last_updated` Date falls within a specified _DateRange_.
                    A _DateRange_ can be defined by providing less than `lt` and/or greater than `gt` values.
                    This parameter can be included in a request one or more times.
                    
                    Examples:
                      - `_lastUpdated=gt2023-01-02&_lastUpdated=lt2023-05-01` defines a range between two provided dates
                      - `_lastUpdated=gt2023-01-02` defines a range between the provided date and today
                      - `_lastUpdated=lt2023-05-01` defines a range from the earliest available records until the provided date
                  example: "gt2023-01-02"

                  description: |-
                    The _Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration_ (SAMHSA)
                    is the agency within the U.S. Department of HHS that leads public health efforts to advance the behavioral health of the nation.
                    Setting this flag to _true_, modifies the request to filter out all SAMSHA-related claims from the response.
                    _ClaimResponse_ doesn't contain any SAMHSA potential data. Due to the 1:1 relationship between _ClaimResponse_
                    and _Claim_, any ClaimResponse resource will be excluded when the associated Claim resource contains SAMHSA data.
                    
                    Example:
                      - `excludeSAMHSA=true`
                  enum: ["true", "false"]
                includeTaxNumber:
                  type: string
                  description: |-
                    Setting this flag to _true_, provides tax number in the EOB transformed data for the response.
                    
                    Example:
                       - `includeTaxNumbers=true`
                  enum: ["true", "false"]

                    Only satisfy the Search request if a claim's Date
                    falls within a specified _DateRange_. A _DateRange_ can be
                    defined by providing less than `lt` and/or greater than `gt` values.
                    This parameter can be included in a request one or more times.

                       - `service-date=gt2023-01-02&service-date=lt2023-05-01`
                       - `service-date=gt2023-01-02`
                       - `service-date=lt2023-05-01`

                    When fetching a _Bundle Response_ using pagination, this URL parameter represents an offset
                    (starting point) into the list of elements for the _Request_.
                    It is optional and defaults to 1 if not supplied.
                    A value 0 is not allowed and negative indices are not currently supported.
                    
                    Example:
                       - `startIndex=100`

                    One or more comma-delimited claim types that filters the response to contain only EoBs that include the specified claim types.
                    This is optional and defaults to `*` denoting all types.
                    Supported values for claim type:

                  description: |-
                    The _elements parameter consists of a comma-separated list of base element names. Only elements that are listed are to be returned.
                    Clients SHOULD list desired elements in a resource as part of
                    the list of elements. The list of elements does not apply to included resources.
                    Servers are not obliged to return just the requested elements; mandatory elements are returned whether
                    they are requested or not. Each value of the list may also be a period-separated path to a specified element.
                  example: "identifier.value,identifier.type,status,use,billablePeriod.start,insurer,provider"
