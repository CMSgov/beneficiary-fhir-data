  "description": "The Value Set is a combination of values from volume 3 from the Code System International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and values in the Code System ICD-10 Procedure Coding System.\n\nThe International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) is based on the World Health Organizationâ€™s Ninth Revision, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). ICD-9-CM was the official system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States.\n\nThe ICD-9-CM consists of:\n\n*   a tabular list containing a numerical list of the disease code numbers in tabular form;\n*   an alphabetical index to the disease entries; and\n*   a classification system for surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures (alphabetic index and tabular list).\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/) are the U.S. governmental agencies responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications to the ICD-9-CM.\n\nThe ICD-10-PCS is the replacement for ICD-9-CM, volume 3, effective October 1, 2015.\n\nThe ICD-10-PCS is a procedure classification published by the United States Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) ([https://www.cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/)) for classifying procedures\nperformed in hospital inpatient health care settings.\n\nCurrent and previous releases of ICD-9-CM are available here: [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm)\n\nMost files are provided in compressed zip format for ease in downloading.
