# SAMHSA-Related Codes

The `codes-*` files here are used by `gov.cms.bfd.server.war.stu3.providers.SamhsaMatcher` to determine which claims are related to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA). See `/bluebutton-data-server.git/dev/design-samhsa-filtering.md` for a detailed design of the feature.
