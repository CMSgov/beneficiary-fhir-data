# BFD Data Dictionary

The BFD Data Dictionary project provides data dictionary and mapping information for the Beneficiary FHIR Data Server.


## Design

The /data folder contains JSON respresentations of each element in the DD, separated by major BFD version V1 and V2.
The /app folder contains simple python scripts to read and transform content into external/user facing formats e.g. CSV, HTML, PDF, etc
The python scripts are extremely basic at the time of this writing.  It is likely they will be refactored/rewritten 
to be more bulletproof, use libraries like pandas, be easier to incorporate into CI process, etc. etc.
Runner.ps1 is a powershell script the demonstrates command line usage of each of the scripts
