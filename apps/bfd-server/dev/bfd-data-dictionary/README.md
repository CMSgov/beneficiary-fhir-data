# BFD Data Dictionary

The BFD Data Dictionary project provides data dictionary and mapping information for the Beneficiary FHIR Data Server.


## Design

The /data folder contains JSON respresentations of each element in the DD, separated into folders for major BFD version V1 and V2.

The /app folder contains simple python scripts to read and transform content into external/user facing formats e.g. CSV, HTML, PDF, etc

The python scripts are extremely crude/basic at the time of this writing.  
It is likely they will be refactored/rewritten by someone more capable than me.
(they need to be bulletproofed, use libraries like pandas, be ready for incorporation into CI processes, etc. etc.

Runner.ps1 is a crude powershell script that demonstrates command line usage of each of the scripts
