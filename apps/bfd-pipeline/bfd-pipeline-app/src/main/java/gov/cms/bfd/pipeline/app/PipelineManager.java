   *   <li>{@link ConcurrentMap#size()} SHALL only be read on the {@link VolunteerJob}'s thread
   *       (aside from reads for metrics, which SHALL NOT be used for any application logic).
   *   <li>Jobs SHALL only be removed by {@link PipelineJobWrapper} and {@link PipelineJobCallback},

   *       it.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Following these rules will result in {@link ConcurrentMap#size()} being eventually
   * consistent but nevertheless ALWAYS >= the number of jobs that are actually enqueued, from the
   * view of the {@link VolunteerJob}'s thread. This aligns with what the {@link VolunteerJob} needs
