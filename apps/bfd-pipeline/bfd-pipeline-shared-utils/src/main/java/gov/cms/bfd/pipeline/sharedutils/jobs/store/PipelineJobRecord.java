/**
 * Models the status of a {@link PipelineJob} that has been submitted for execution. This is
 * basically a state machine data store, that models the various states and transitions that a job
 * can proceed through. Jobs can be in the following states:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Created: This is the initial state for every job.
 *   <li>Canceled: Jobs can be cancelled before or during execution.
 *   <li>Enqueued: Once a job has been submitted for execution.
 *   <li>Started: Once a job has started running.
 *   <li>Completed (Succeeded): A job that has successfully finished running, without exceptions.
 *   <li>Completed (Failed): A job that started running but then threw an exception, rather than
 *       completing successfully.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Design Note: I considered coding this <em>as</em> an actual state machine, but all of the
 * libraries and patterns available for doing so in Java looked like they'd add more complexity than
 * they removed. Also: if we ever decided to scale job execution across multiple nodes, this
 * data/class would need to become a JPA entity, and none of the state machine patterns seemed
 * suited to that. For example, <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-statemachine">Spring
 * Statemachine</a> will persist all of the state machine's data as a combined serialized blob,
 * which is not what we need.

  /**
   * "Why is this variable {@code volatile}," you might ask? Good question! The short answer is the
   * unhelpful, "because things can crash unless it is." The <em>better</em> answer is complicated:
   * When the VolunteerJob is bootstrapped, it's enqueued by PipelineManager's constructor, and ends
   * up setting this field -- on the application's main thread. Then, VolunteerJob starts running,
   * and goes looking for non-enqueued jobs. Unless this field is volatile, it will sometimes "find
   * itself" (lol), thinking that it's not enqueued, because it's reading a stale value of it. That
   * causes things to go boom. So: we mark this as volatile, and everything's copacetic. Isn't
   * concurrency fun?!
   *
   * <p>There's also be an issue with the other jobs, where they get enqueued by the VolunteerJob on
   * its thread and then, when they try to fire their start event on their thread, notice that
   * they're not enqueued and freak out about it. Marking this as {@code volatile} fixes that, too.
   *
   * <p>"Okay, so why aren't the other fields {@code volatile}, too," you might then ask? Also a
   * good question! It's because the start and completed events always run on the job's worker
   * thread and those events aren't queried on any other threads for anything important. (Worth
   * noting: the {@code final} are safe, just due to how they're treated in the Java Memory Model.)
   *
   * <p>"You left out cancel, though," you might follow up with. Good catch! But mostly, it just
   * doesn't really matter, even though it is set by a different thread, as it's not relied on for
   * anything important.
   *
   * <p>If <strong>any</strong> of these other fields end up landing in application logic, we may
   * need to mark them volatile -- depending on exactly how they're used and accessed.
