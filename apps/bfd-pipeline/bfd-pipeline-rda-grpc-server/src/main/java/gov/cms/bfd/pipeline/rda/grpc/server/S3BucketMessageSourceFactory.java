/**
 * To save on the number of unnecessary calls to S3 to retrieve files and to allow the incremental
 * addition of files over time this implementation of {@link MessageSource.Factory} checks an S3
 * bucket for files matching a pattern that consists of a prefix, the range of sequence numbers in
 * the file, and a suffix. If no files matching this pattern are found but a file has a name equal
 * to the prefix followed by the suffix then that file is considered to hold all valid claims. When
 * one or more files match they are sorted by range and only those files containing sequence numbers
 * greater than or equal to the desired starting number are read. The matching files are then served
 * one after another in sequence number order.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: The files can have overlapping sequence numbers and/or sequence numbers that don't
 * correspond to the values in the object key. No effort is made to compensate for configuration
 * errors. As a consequence if the files contain data that differs from their file names or if they
 * have records out of order within the file the resulting stream of records might not be in
 * increasing order by sequence number.
