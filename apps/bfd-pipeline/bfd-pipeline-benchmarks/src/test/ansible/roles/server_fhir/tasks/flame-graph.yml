# Sets up the tools needed to generate flame graphs of the FHIR server's 
# process. Note that it doesn't actually generate or collect any flame graphs; 
# it just prepares the environment for a dev/op to do so.
# 
# Once this has been applied, a dev/op can log into the system via SSH and then
# run the following to generate a flame graph:
# 
#     $ echo -e 'bb-fhir\tALL=(ALL)\tNOPASSWD: ALL' | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
#     $ sudo su -s /bin/bash - bb-fhir
#     $ PERF_RECORD_SECONDS=120 PERF_FLAME_OUTPUT=/tmp/flamegraph.svg FLAMEGRAPH_DIR=/usr/local/FlameGraph-master /usr/local/perf-map-agent-master/bin/perf-java-flames $(pgrep --full ".*java.*-Dbluebutton-server.*")
# 
# After this command completes, the generated flame graph can be found in 
# `/tmp/flamegraph.svg`, which can be copied back to the dev's/op's system via 
# `scp`.
