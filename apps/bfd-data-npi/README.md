BFD NPI to Organization Name Lookup
=======================================

This maven project produces a jar file that provides functionality to retrieve organization names given an NPI as input. This lookup is backed by a data file stored in the jar files as a resource.

The data file is constructed from 
NPI|Entity Type Code|Replacement NPI|Employer Identification Number (EIN)|Provider Organization Name (Legal Business Name)Provider Last Name (Legal Name)|Provider First Name|

The data file is constructed by stripping out all the entity code type 1 (Individual NPI Numbers) and only leaving the entity type code 2 (Organization NPI Numbers). With only the Organization NPI Numbers left, a file is constructed that contains the NPI Number and the Provider Organization Name (Legal Business Name).
